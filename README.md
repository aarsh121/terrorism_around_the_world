# Terrorism around the world
According to a survey, about 218 million people are affected by calamities, natural and man-made, per annum and about 68000 people loose their lives every year. The frequency of natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanoes, etc have remained broadly constant, but the number of terrorist activities have grown over the period.

The aim of this notebook is to explore the terrorist events around the world. Interactive Plots and Animations are used in this notebook, for making the exploration easy and more informative. This is my first try on Folium, which is a wrapper over the Leaflet.js API.Some things that we will explore are the trends in terrorism over the year, the terrorism prone areas, etc. Since it is a geographic dataset, you will see a lot of geomaps.

Note: I have only used first 5000 rows for folium maps. The reason is the notebook or script crashes a lot and it kills the kernel due to long execution time.
